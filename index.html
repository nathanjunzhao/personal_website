            <p> Hi!</p>
            <p>My name is Nathan Zhao. <br> I am a freshman at Rice University double majoring in Computer Science and Sports Analytics.</p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about solving difficult and complex problems with math, logic, and code! 
                <br>
                Outside of that, I love watching and playing sports like basketball and volleyball, practicing Muay Thai, and eating delicious food!
                <br>
                I also enjoy giving back to the community and connecting with others over hobbies, interesting topics, and thought-provoking projects!
            </p>
            <p>See below for a few projects I've been a part of!</p>

                    The Calgary Science Spelling Challenge (CSSC) is an organization based in my hometown in Calgary, Canada that worked to
                    encourage scientific exploration in youth through vocabulary and teamwork during a science-themed team-based annual spelling 
                    bee we hosted. Before leaving for university, I was the Vice President of the organization and fully in-charge of the technological
                    side of the event: the website, scoring, and tabulation.

                    BundleUp was a temporary business made under the Junior Achievement (JA) program. The business strived to make the adjacent 
                    street to our school a more accessible source of food, snacks, and merchandise for our students. More importantly, it aimed to 
                    re-ignite the stagnated passion of the street that the Covid-19 pandemic caused through incentivising student engagement in the 
                    street's stores. I was the Vice President of IT in this organization and I designed the coupon delivery system of our business that 
                    served as our primary product to provide discounts to students who purchased our "Bundles" of coupons.

                    As a member of my highschool "Leadership" program I engaged heavily in the athletic community in a variety of ways. Outside 
                    of physical engagement, I also helped manage the athletic website, team photos on the website, updates and announcements, as 
                    well as the website's design and pages. Additionally, under the volleyball team I collected statistics and game-footage for players 
                    and coaches. In this way, I was both a technician and statistician for the athletic community in my highschool, as well as an athlete.
